# pandas-challenge
For this challenge I was able to figure out all the pandas functions, though I did struggle at times, especially with some of the syntax. I was also surprised somewhat by some of the results, though I went over that in more detail in the notebook.

I built a lot off of the starter code, but obviously managed to adapt it as needed to complete all the tasks, and my results lined up with what was given.
